WARNING:root:Loading with weights_only=True failed (Weights only load failed. In PyTorch 2.6, we changed the default value of the `weights_only` argument in `torch.load` from `False` to `True`. Re-running `torch.load` with `weights_only` set to `False` will likely succeed, but it can result in arbitrary code execution. Do it only if you got the file from a trusted source.
Please file an issue with the following so that we can make `weights_only=True` compatible with your use case: WeightsUnpickler error:
